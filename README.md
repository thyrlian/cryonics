> **Cryonics** (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'cold') is the low-temperature preservation (usually at -196°C) of people who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that resuscitation and restoration to full health may be possible in the far future. Cryopreservation of humans is not reversible with present technology; cryonicists hope that medical advances will someday allow cryopreserved people to be revived.

##Features
 ✭ Saved data can be automatically synced with Chrome sync (no other account needed).

 ✭ Neat UI, powered by Twitter's Bootstrap.

 ✭ The hint (optional) for saving can be a word or phrase, just to remind you what the opened tabs are about.  If it's empty, the saving identifier will consist of a timestamp and the number of tabs, e.g. 2013-12-18T20:15:59 (10 tabs).

 ✭ After saving, it wouldn't close your chrome window.  Thus, you can continue working on those tabs if you want.

 ✭ You can save as many times as you want, they'll be stored as different entries.

 ✭ Right after saved tabs are opened, the saved entry will be automatically removed. (GTD - Getting Things Done)
