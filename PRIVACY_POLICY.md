# Privacy Policy for the Cryonics Chrome Extension

## Introduction
Our Chrome extension, Cryonics, is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy provides details about the types of information we collect from users of the Cryonics extension and how it is used and safeguarded.

## Information Collection and Use
- **Usage Data**: Cryonics does not collect any personal data or browsing history. The extension operates entirely locally on your device.
- **Saved Tabs**: The URLs of the tabs you opt to save are stored using Chrome's `storage.sync` API. This data includes the URLs of your saved tabs, which can be synchronized across devices where you are logged in with the same Google account. The synchronization feature enhances the user experience by providing access to saved tabs across various devices but does not transmit this data to the extension developers or any third parties.

## Data Storage
- **Synced Storage**: Data saved by Cryonics, specifically the URLs of saved tabs, is stored using Chrome's `storage.sync` API. While this data is stored locally on your device, it can also be synced across devices where you are logged in with the same Google account. This synchronization is managed by Google Chrome and adheres to Google's privacy and security policies.

## Data Security
We prioritize the security of your data. The information stored by the extension is secured by Chrome's storage API, and the synchronization feature is protected under your Google account's security. It's important to use strong security practices for your Google account to ensure the protection of your synced data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage users to frequently check for updates.
